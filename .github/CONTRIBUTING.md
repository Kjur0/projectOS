# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to projectOS contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

Search [projectOS wiki](https://github.com/Kjur0/projectOS/wiki) for any needed information. If you can't find it feel free to open issue asking for it.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot any problem, search if an issue already exists. If any related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Kjur0/projectOS/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Kjur0/projectOS/issues) to find one that interests you (you should check issues with [help wanted](https://github.com/Kjur0/projectOS/labels/help%20wanted) label first). You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, our team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
